##Redisson - distributed and scalable Java data structures on top of Redis server. Advanced Java Redis client

Use familiar Java data structures with power of [Redis](http://redis.io).

Based on high-performance async and lock-free Java Redis client and [Netty 4](http://netty.io) framework.  
Redis 2.8+ and JDK 1.6+ compatible
